    <p>I will be using the Drugs dataset.<br>
    I do not have any questions about the dataset, the format of the data and the data itself makes sense to me.<br>
    I would like to know the ratio between population and new users of weed in Alaska for ages 12-17 in the year 2002.<br>
    Using the data, I was able to find out the ratio is 7.77/66297 people in Alaska in 2002. Or about 1/8532.43 people became new users of weed.<br>
